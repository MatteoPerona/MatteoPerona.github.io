I am a student at University of California San Diego studying data science with an emphasis on machine learning. I love [making music](https://soundcloud.com/teo-perona) and surfing in my free time. 

I’m currently researching systems which identify and extract structured data from text using LLMs in order to build better datasets by distilling the unstructured information that already exists on the web. In my startup, [Riso Data](https://www.risodata.com/), we’re applying this technology to build a real-time graph database modeling agricultural supply chains in the global south, starting with West Africa. 

I also co-founded a student org called [COMPASS](https://compassinstitution.com/) where we carry out data science projects for social good. Our Global Project aims to quantify and predict food insecurity in developing countries. Instead, our Local Project uses language models to distill the most relevant gripes/ideas that students at UCSD are expressing on social platforms as a means to help administration gain a better understanding of what the student body is feeling.
